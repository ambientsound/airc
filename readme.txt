Please view source code with Visual Basic 6 Enterprise Edition.

To view the source code, make sure the latest aircutils.ocx
is a registered OCX, then open the airc_utils.vbg project file.
You should also make sure you have all the Visual Basic runtime
files, but those should be included with Visual Studio.
